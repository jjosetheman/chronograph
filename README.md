A 2020 Remake of the Hayes Chronograph
Scott Baker, http://www.smbaker.com/

# Purpose

The Hayes Chronograph was a device sold in the 80s to serve as a real-time clock for computers that didn't have a built in clock. They're rather hard to find these days. I've always wanted one so I made a modern remake.

My website at https://www.smbaker.com/ generally has most of the text, descriptions, and narrative for my projects, so if you've stumbled onto the github repository but not the website, then you probably want to start with the website. There's also links to my youtube videos there.
